# BigKnow2022

BigKnow2022 is an upcoming up-to-date dataset intended for training language
models. Its contents are primarily derived from various websites.

**We are currently seeking contributors to assist in dataset collection and
filtering.**

## Rationale

Existing large-scale datasets such as the Pile or vanilla Common Crawl all
have notable downsides:

* Insufficient attention given to non-English or non-European languages.
  In particular, CJK languages tend to be neglected the most.

* Information that is now two or more years out of date.

* English
