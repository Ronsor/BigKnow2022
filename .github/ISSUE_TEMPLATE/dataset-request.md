**Name of source?**
Simply the name of the data source, e.g. Wikipedia, Syosetu ni Narou, Twitter, userABC on Reddit, etc.

**URL of source?**
Where the data can be found; multiple links are acceptable if necessary.

**Data format?**
The format the data is already in, e.g. Wikitext, HTML, markdown, PDF.

**Should the data be converted to another format?**
Whether it's appropriate to convert the data to a plain text or markdown. Usually "yes," but if you're submitting a dataset of code, it would be inappropriate to strip HTML tags.

**Notes for scraping?**
Any notes or useful information for the scraping process, if applicable, e.g. "there's an API that returns a list of pages at /api/v1/list" or "the site heavily rate limits, so you may need to use multiple IPs." If the data is available as a convenient archive or download already, you'd mention that here
